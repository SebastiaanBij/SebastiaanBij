### âœ¨ Welcome to my GitHub Profile âœ¨
## ðŸ“– Summary ðŸ“–
I am a young and enthousiastic ICT student who wants to become a developer. Currently I am studying at Zuyd Hogeschool in Heerlen and I am in my second year. I also have my own company called Software Bee IT which offers a number of ICT related services.

## ðŸ“š What am I currently working on? ðŸ“š
Currently I am working on a number of projects outside of my company work. These are:
- PyFriends:
  - A Discord bot which will send a message to a certain server channel when a member goes live on Twitch. It will provide some extra information about the stream and give the URL.
  - *This project is closed-source.*
- A not yet name project:
  - This is a project I will not yet reveal. I am working on this project with a number of my friends. These friends are [Nando Kools](https://github.com/BlaxadowFire) and Job Banens.
  - *This project is closed-source.*
